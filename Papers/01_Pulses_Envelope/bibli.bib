  year          = {2020},
  month         = sep,
  abstract      = {The temporal amplitude envelope of a signal is essential for its complete characterization, being the primary information-carrying medium in spoken voice and telecommunications, for example. Envelope detection techniques have applications in areas like health, sound classification and synthesis, seismology and speech recognition. Nevertheless, a general method to digital envelope detection of signals with rich spectral content doesn't exist, as most methods involve manual intervention, in the form of filter design, smoothing, as well as other specific design choices, based on a priori knowledge about the nature of the specific waves under investigation. To address this problem, we propose a framework that uses intrinsic characteristics of a signal to estimate its envelope, completely eliminating the necessity of parameter tuning. The approach here described draws inspiration from geometric concepts to isolate the frontiers and thus estimate the temporal envelope of an arbitrary signal; to that end, alpha-shapes, concave hulls, and discrete curvature are explored. We also define entities, such as a pulse and frontiers, in the context of an arbitrary digital signal, as a means to reduce dimensionality and the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Specifically, a new measure of discrete curvature is used to obtain the average radius of curvature of a discrete wave, serving as a threshold to identify the wave's frontier points. We find the algorithm accurate in the identification of the frontiers of a wide range of digital sound waves with very diverse characteristics, while localizing each pseudo-cycle of the wave in the time domain. The algorithm also compares favourably with classic envelope detection techniques based on filtering and the Hilbert Transform.},

  abstract = {Cubic spline interpolating the local maximal/minimal points is often employed to calculate the envelopes of a signal approximately. However, the undershoots occur frequently in the cubic spline envelopes. To improve them, in our previous paper we proposed a new envelope algorithm, which is an iterative process by using the Monotone Piecewise Cubic Interpolation. Experiments show very satisfying results. But the theoretical analysis on why and how it works well was not given there. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the algorithm. We will study the structure of undershoots, prove rigorously that the algorithm converges to an envelope without undershoots with exponential rate of convergence, which can be used to determine the number of iterations needed in the algorithm for a good envelope in applications.},
