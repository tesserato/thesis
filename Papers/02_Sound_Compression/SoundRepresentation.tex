% Present tense to refer to stablished facts

% Background (What is already known about the subject)
Sample based virtual instruments are the de facto standard for the emulation of real word acoustic instruments. Nevertheless little attention is given to the encoding of the samples used in those instruments; in fact, lossless containers like wav or proprietary formats are common, pushing the on disk size of those libraries to sizes exceeding the gigabytes.
% Motivation (Why do we care about the problem and the results?) 
This renders the most realistic digital instruments inaccessible in many but the most high-end hardware; controllers, like electronic drum kits and controller keyboards and even less robust personal computers might encounter problems implementing those software.
% Problem | Objectives (What problem is the paper trying to solve?) (Scope)
We propose a lossy compression algorithm tailored specifically to highly uniform sounds, as those present in these instruments, due to the nature of the sounds, highly redundant, substantial improvements can be obtained, with minimal quality loss.

% Methods | Procedure | Approach (What did you actually do to get your results?)

% Results | Findings | Product (what did you learn | invent | create?)

% Conclusions | Implications (What are the larger implications of your findings)
The method, being physically informed, also serves as base 
lends itself well to machine learning, as the sound can be represented by an evolving waveform over time (pseudo-cycles)

% Opener sentence (Question | Assertion | Intriguing Revelations)
Many of the proposed benefits of an electronic drumkit, like portability and practicity, are compromised when, to obtain a realistic sound on par with the acoustic counterpart, the output of the drumkit has to be processed in another piece of hardware, such as a personal computer.

The same is true for digital pianos.

This transforms the instrument in a mere controller, robbing it of characteristics that provide the personality of the conventional instruments, such as a particular timbre.

While domain specific compression algorithms and codecs exist in many areas, to the best of the authors' knowledge, that is not the case for sample based digital musical instruments. Those signals, being highly uniform, offer an opportunity for compression that is not presente in most general sounds

  % How did you do it?
  % Justify choices
  % Describe the work so as people can reproduce it

% Overview of methods
A continuous or discrete signal, as long as it is at least pseudo periodic, can be interpreted as succession of consecutive waveforms, each one representing a (pseudo) cycle of the wave. In the case of perfectly periodic signals, those waveforms are identical and we need only the definition of one waveform to characterise the whole signal.in pseudo periodic waves, On the other hand there are potentially variations between pseudo cycles, that must be accounted for. If the wave is sufficiently well behaved, as is the case with most sound arising from accoustic phenomenons, these changes can be attributed to variations in both the amplitude of the waveform and its length


Starting with an initial estimate of the waveform of the signal being processed, one can identify the pseudo cycles of a signal by convolving the estimated waveform with the signal. The process can be made computationally efficient by considering some characteristics of the wave.

% Problems with results

Since the average waveform is used to encode the specificities of the wave, signals where there are signficant variations in the sape of the waveform are naturally ill suited for compression with the presented algorithm. This limitation can be mitigated with a pre processing step where the waveform is segmented based on the overal shape of the waveform

% Possible implications

\section{Discussion} % ≅ 2000 words

% Put results into a broader context.
While presenting an efficient algorithm to compress sufficiently well behaved signals, with immediate applications in the digital musical instrument industry, this work presents a new framework for representing pseudo periodic waves that can be extended in inumerous ways, with the help of both traditional and experimental methods.

While we simply consider the average waveform when encoding the compressed wave, more sofisticated representations can be used. The average waveform can be further compressed via a parametric representation.
